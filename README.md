# VolumeHandControl
This project deals with opencv-python and mediapipe to it's core but also takes the help of numpy and pycaw(for volume control). This is a really great project to startoff with to polish your concepts
of image processing and makes you use several inbuilt modules to achieve the goal. The Hand tracking module comes in handy which is availible as a separate
repo but I have included those files in this as well. Do refer to that before referring to The main project.
<li> The HandTrackingMin is the minimum code required to pull off tracking your hand
<li> The HandTrackingModule has the program in class format and can be easily accesssed by any other project
<li> The VolumeHandControl is the main project which will help you control the volume of the computer using gestures
